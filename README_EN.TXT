This program is designed for manipulation with "version.txt" files.
Since v1.1 it also may fix "There is no need for update" on 5.50 GEN.
(Full text is:
"The system software of your PSPâ„¢
system is version 9.90.
There is no need to update.")

Homebrew cames in two variants:
1. OFW_MODE - have no flash0 access, more safe
2. CFW_MODE - have flash0 access for advanced users =)

So, you may flash your own files in some places easely!
E.g., ms0:/seplugins/version.txt for ME cfw...
...or ef0:/seplugins/usbversion.txt for PRO cfw =)
Also it have some other paths for old HENs e.t.c.
Or you may protect your PSP via flashing v9.99 version.txt into flash0.

Where to place files:
[Root of MemStick or ExtFlash]
|-PSP
 |-GAME
  |-V_SWITCH
   |-EBOOT.PBP
   |-version1.txt
   |-version2.txt
   |-version3.txt
   |-version4.txt

Thanks for reading!
